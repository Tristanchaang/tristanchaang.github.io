title: On Continuous Distributions (Attached)
---

Here is an article I have written about the several continuous distributions that we learnt in high-school, namely the normal distribution, t-distribution and chi-squared distributions. 

These are all bell-shaped curves, and therefore it is meaningless to define a normal distribution as a _bell-shaped distribution_ without further discription. In the article, I will explain in-depth the meaning of randomness and give proofs and results about the properties of these distributions, and what makes them differ from each other. 

Most importantly, I will be deriving the curve equations (called the _pdf_) for each of these distributions.
