Ignorance is the curse of God; 
knowledge is the wing wherewith we fly to heaven. (Act IV Scene 7)

By any other name would smell as sweet. (Act II Scene 2)

### Julius Caesar

Cowards die many times before their deaths. (Act II Scene 2)

Et tu Brute? Then fall Caesar! (Act III Scene 1)

### The Art of War

If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. (知己知彼，百战不殆。)
