<p>I've worked part-time as a maths olympiad trainer for elementary-school and high-school students, and it was fun to interact with them especially when they come up with difficult questions. Many years ago I shared with them the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)"><em>green-eyed and blue-eyed logic problem</em></a>, and after I finished explaining the induction argument, someone asked me: "So what exactly is the difference before and after the outsider came? Can't they follow those lines as reasoning as well before the outsider came and said something this brutally obvious ('At least one of you has blue eyes.')?". At that point of time I realised I still haven't understood the concept completely, and then spent literally days to think about this. In the end I finally understood the difference: The outsider's statement turned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_knowledge_(logic)"><em>mutual knowledge</em></a> into common knowledge. Maybe I will write another post about this interesting logic problem.</p>
