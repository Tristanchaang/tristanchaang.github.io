Yesterday I found out about GitHub from my friend Hua Zhi, and thus I started to make one. Here is what happened throughout the journey. I will continually update this page if I encounter new concepts about webpages.</p>
<p>Last year I downloaded Visual Studio Code (VS Code). At first I only used it for some competitive programming using C++ and some animated video creation (see this page!) using Python, but a few months later I learnt HTML, CSS and Javascript, and so I put it into good use.</p>
<p>However, that was some very limited knowledge I have. I didn't even know how to make the website public. I then attended a built-in course on <a href="https://lab.github.com/">lab.github.com</a>, and with my friend teaching me extra stuff (e.g. Jekyll, Markdown, MathJAX), I finally managed to create this webpage.</p>
<p>At the same time, I went to my college library and borrowed book titled <em>HTML, CSS and Javascript</em> by Julie C. Meloni. I learnt so much from it.</p>
